## Weakly Supervised Object Localization

The project exploits the use of pre-trained CNNâ€™s for Weakly supervised deep detection of image regions, performing simultaneous region selection and classification without using image-level annotations.
A novel end-to-end method that classifies and predicts bounding boxes using AlexNet on PASCAL VOC data through the use of spatial pyramid pooling.

## Visual Question Answering

Implmented a Multi-Modal Visual Question Answering model using pre-trained RoBERTa and TransformerNet architecture.
Incorporated self-attention and cross-attention to aid interactions between textual and visual features.
Achieved an accuracy of 67.62%
