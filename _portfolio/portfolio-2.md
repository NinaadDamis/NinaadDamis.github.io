## Particle Filter Localization

Implemented a Particle Filter to estimate pose of a differential drive robot using measurements from a 180-degree laser range finder.
<!-- - **Objective:** Design and analyze differential gearboxes using SAE 8620 and EN 36C to determine the most suitable material for specific automotive uses. -->

## Extended kalman Filter SLAM

- Implemented a 2D EKF-SLAM solver in Python to estimate the trajectory of a 2D robot and the positions of the landmarks from the control input and measurements in an unknown environment.

- The magenta and blue ellipses represent the predicted and updated uncertainties of the robotâ€™s position. The red and green ellipses represent the initial and updated uncertainties of the landmarks.

## Dense 3D SLAM 

- Implemented a 3D dense SLAM system using point-based fusion by utilizing projective Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and point-based fusion.
- The image shows the resultant 3D reconstruction obtained for the ICL-NUIM dataset
